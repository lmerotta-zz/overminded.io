Each person has its own "pre-requisites" for happiness at work. Some people just want a motivating job and don't care about the rest, while others even need to have the perfect desk, with the perfect chair to sit on, otherwise they'll feel unhappy.

This is a list of things that I find important, in order to feel and be happy at work:



## Colleagues

Remember that you'll spend most of your week with your colleagues, so it'd be best if you and them went along fine.

Colleagues must be people that you find inspiring. People that you look forward to working with. They should help you evolve, and bring you as much knowledge as they can.

Not only this, but they also should be people that you can be friend with. Everybody says to always keep work and personal life separate. However, I think it's fine if sometimes you can go grab a good beer with one or more of your colleagues, and talk about something completely out of purpose regarding to your job.

Try not to surround you with colleagues that are always negative, or see everything as *evil*. Those colleagues tend to bring you a lot of frustration, and it tends to grow on you very fast.

## Superiors

Your superiors must be strict, but should also listen to the employees. That does not mean they should let you walk all over them.

They should understand that sometimes, you cannot work at your full potential. Sometimes, you need to take some rest. Maybe you struggle on a problem, and need some air in order to let your brain rest for a minute ? If that raises a problem with your superiors, just *flee*.

## Challenge

Personally, the more I find a job challenging, the more I tend to work harder on it. Simple brainless work isn't my jam at all. 

## Management

Working in a too strict environment ? Meh. What about some unorganized company, where no one knows what his/her place is ? **WORSE.**

There is a sweet spot, right in the middle between being overly organized and complete mess. The rules have to be clear, but there should be some way to bend them just a little bit.

For example, the company where I work offers flexible hours. We *need*  to be present at 8:45 for the daily standup meeting, however a coworker can come at 7:00, and leave earlier than the others. 

This provides the needed flexibility to allow each person to deal with their daily job, and personnal life.





Being happy at work is important. It can impact your productivity, your mood, and even your way of life outside of work! I'm sure everyone already experienced working in a company without really being happy with it. 

Maybe you, who are reading this, are in this situation right now. If so, maybe some of my points will strike you, and you'll find a way to get out of this situation.
